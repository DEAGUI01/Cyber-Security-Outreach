# Cyber-Security-Outreach
This project is to educate the public about how to protect their information assets. The goal is 
to raise security awareness so that people build security mindsets and learn good security 
practices. This is not about security training, but about an awareness campaign. I decided to target the project towards the senior population, since they tend to be on of the most targeted demographics by hackers and online scammers. The presentation was conducted at a local nursing home called Wesley Manor. See attachments for a copy of the presentation, pictures at the site, and other files.
